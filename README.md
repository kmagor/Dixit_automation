# Dixit_automation
python, open CV, excel

The printed A4 paper contains 2 filled square for each player.
One for indicating wether he/she/it is the story teller. The other one indicates the placed bets on his/her/its card.

The circles will be differenciated, by the holes on them like it would be on a traditional dice but with holes instead the black dots.

And the python script would load the data to the excel, which can indicate the current stage of the game.
